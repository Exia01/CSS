There are explicit and implicit targeting.

There are points raking in which css proceeds to target:

ID --> 100pts

Class --> 10pts

Element --> 1pt

- Whichever selector has the most points wins.
- If two elements are identical, the bottom-most wins.
    - this is is because of the "Cascade"

- Important 
    - Nothing else can override it.
        - ***CAUTION*** when using this.
        - Makes it more difficult to troubleshoot.
